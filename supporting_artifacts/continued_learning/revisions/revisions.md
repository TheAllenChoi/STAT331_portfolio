An example of me revising my code was in Challenge 3, where you gave me the feedback of using an additional summarize() step instead of having two separate dataframes and then using cbind(). 

I used rbind and cbind to get the means for each variable, but then I realized that the summarize function can do what I did in only two lines of code. When I realized that, solving the problem became a lot simpler than I thought it was at first. Instead of making two dataframes, I was able to use summarize to do in one line what it took me 5 extra lines of code to do. 

The main reason why I included this example in my revisions was that I was really proud of finding out a much more efficient method in solving the Challenge. I definitely felt like my knowledge of R grew, especially in the use of dplyr.

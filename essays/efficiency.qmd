Efficiency to my understanding is making sure that a task can be completed in the least time and work needed to accomplish it. In terms of statistical computing, it means that the analysis is done using the most concise code possible. It allows us to remove extra steps that take up space in our code and also allows for easier error-correction. This is so important when you spend a long time writing your code, you want to be able to have it run as fast as possible and as easily read as possible. A key a-ha moment I had was in Challenge 4, where I originally used a large number of rbinds and cbinds in order to obtain the means for each variable. However, Professor Theobold provided feedback on how this could be done more efficiently, and after using the summarize() function that she suggested, I only had to end up using two lines.

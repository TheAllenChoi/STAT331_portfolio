Efficiency to my understanding is making sure that a task can be completed in the least time and work needed to accomplish it. In terms of statistical computing, it means that the analysis is done using the most concise code possible. It allows us to remove extra steps that take up space in our code and also allows for easier error-correction. This is so important because we as statisticians can spend 5 minutes writing several lines of code instead of 30 minutes writing many lines of code that takes forever to run. A key a-ha moment I had was in Challenge 4, where I originally used a large number of rbinds and cbinds in order to obtain the means for each variable. However, Professor Theobold provided feedback on how this could be done more efficiently, and after using the summarize function that she suggested, I only had to end up using two lines.

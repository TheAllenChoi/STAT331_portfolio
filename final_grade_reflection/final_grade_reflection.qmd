I believe that so far I earned a B in this course. WD-1 was shown in Lab 2 #1. WD-2 was shown in Lab 5 #5. WD-3 was shown in Lab 4 #3. WD-4 was shown in Lab 4 #6 and Lab 5 #8. WD-5 and WD-6 was shown in Lab 4 #2. WD-7 was shown in Lab 4 #7. R-1 was shown in Lab 5 "Reading in Data". R-2 was partially shown in Lab 5 #1. R-3 was shown in Lab 4 #4. DVS-1 was shown in Lab 5 #6 and #7. DSV-2 and DSV-3 was shown in Lab 5 #6. DVS-4 and DVS-5 were shown in Challenge 3 #2. DVS-6 and DVS-7 was shown in Challenge 9 #1. PE-1 was shown in Challenge 3 #2. PE-2 was shown in Lab 8 #2. PE-3 was shown in Lab 8 #4. PE-4 was shown in Lab 4 #7. DSM-1 was shown in PA 9 #4. DSM-2 was shown in Challenge 9 #4. I believe I have completed almost every single one of the learning targets which shows sufficient proficiency in the content of this course.

In terms of revised thinking, I have sometimes taken advantage of the one-week limit of the revision submissions. This is shown when I revised Challenge 3 and significantly increased the efficiency of my code. However, looking back I realize that I should have taken advantage of revising many more previous lab assignments, which brings down my grade from an A.

In terms of extending thinking, I think that I have demonstrated a significant effort in extending my thinking. I have attempted all the Challenge problems available and feel like I put in a significant effort towards applying the thinking I learned in the labs. I feel like this is best shown in Challenge 4, where I was excited to be working with data that I personally found online and was able to produce graphs on that data. I feel like I was able to apply a majority of the learning targets that this course was designed to teach me on that problem. In this portion of my grade, I believe that I excelled.

In terms of being a collaborative group member, I have been present for all of the lectures and ask questions for my team members when necessary. I complete all of the preview activities to make sure I don't hold back my team. However, a few labs and challenges were submitted late towards the beginning of the quarter, though I feel like I improved in that regard as the quarter progressed. In this section of my grade, I believe that I performed only a little above what was expected of me.

In terms of peer-code review, I have unfortunately not been as dutiful as I should be in reviewing my peers code. While at the beginning of the quarter I completed most of the peer code reviews, I definitely started to slack off towards the middle and end. In this portion of my grade, I believe that I performed sub-par.

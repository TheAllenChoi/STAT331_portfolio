I believe that so far I earned a B in this course. WD-1 was shown in Lab 2 #1. WD-2 was shown in Lab 5 #5. WD-3 was shown in Lab 4 #3. WD-4 was shown in Lab 4 #6. WD-5 and WD-6 was shown in Lab 4 #2. WD-7 was shown in Lab 4 #7. R-1 was shown in Lab 5 "Reading in Data". R-2 was partially shown in Lab 5 #1. R-3 was shown in Lab 4 #4. DVS-1 was shown in Lab 5 #6 and #7. DSV-2 and DSV-3 was shown in Lab 5 #6. DVS-4 and DVS-5 were shown in Challenge 3 #2. DVS-6 and DVS-7 was shown in Challenge 9 #1. PE-1 was shown in Challenge 3 #2. PE-2 was shown in Lab 8 #2. PE-3 was shown in Lab 8 #4. PE-4 was shown in Lab 4 #7. DSM-1 was shown in PA 9 #4. DSM-2 was shown in Challenge 9 #4.

In terms of revised thinking, I have sometimes taken advantage of the one-week limit of the revision submissions. From Challenge 3, I learned to have concise code as well as to not have warning messages show up when data is being read, which I have applied to current assignments. This is shown when I revised Challenge 3 and significantly increased the efficiency of my code. However, looking back I realize that I should have taken advantage of revising many more previous lab assignments, which brings down my grade from an A.

In terms of extending thinking, I think that I have demonstrated a significant effort in extending my thinking. I have received

In terms of being a collaborative group member, I have been present for all of the lectures and ask questions for my team members when necessary. I complete all of the preview activities to make sure I don't hold back my team. However, I am either slightly or very late for a large percentage of my labs and challenges which I hope to change in order to raise my grade up to an A.

In terms of peer-code review, I have been slacking off when it comes to reviewing my classmates' code so I hope to change that in the upcoming weeks.

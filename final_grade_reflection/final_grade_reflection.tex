I believe that so far I earned a B in this course. WD-1 was shown in Lab
2 \#1. WD-2 was shown in Lab 5 \#5. WD-3 was shown in Lab 4 \#3. WD-4
was shown in Lab 4 \#6 and Lab 5 \#8. WD-5 and WD-6 was shown in Lab 4
\#2. WD-7 was shown in Lab 4 \#7. R-1 was shown in Lab 5 ``Reading in
Data''. R-2 was partially shown in Lab 5 \#1. R-3 was shown in Lab 4
\#4. DVS-1 was shown in Lab 5 \#6 and \#7. DSV-2 and DSV-3 was shown in
Lab 5 \#6. DVS-4 and DVS-5 were shown in Challenge 3 \#2. DVS-6 and
DVS-7 was shown in Challenge 9 \#1. PE-1 was shown in Challenge 3 \#2.
PE-2 was shown in Lab 8 \#2. PE-3 was shown in Lab 8 \#4. PE-4 was shown
in Lab 4 \#7. DSM-1 was shown in PA 9 \#4. DSM-2 was shown in Challenge
9 \#4.

In terms of revised thinking, I have sometimes taken advantage of the
one-week limit of the revision submissions. From Challenge 3, I learned
to have concise code as well as to not have warning messages show up
when data is being read, which I have applied to current assignments.
This is shown when I revised Challenge 3 and significantly increased the
efficiency of my code. However, looking back I realize that I should
have taken advantage of revising many more previous lab assignments,
which brings down my grade from an A.

In terms of extending thinking, I think that I have demonstrated a
significant effort in extending my thinking. I have received

In terms of being a collaborative group member, I have been present for
all of the lectures and ask questions for my team members when
necessary. I complete all of the preview activities to make sure I don't
hold back my team. However, I am either slightly or very late for a
large percentage of my labs and challenges which I hope to change in
order to raise my grade up to an A.

In terms of peer-code review, I have been slacking off when it comes to
reviewing my classmates' code so I hope to change that in the upcoming
weeks.
